Learning github 
## What is the difference between clone and fork ?
### clone 
It used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a repository.
it wil change original code when we made any change in cloned repo and pushed it.
### Fork
A git fork is a personal, server side copy of a repository.
allowing you to freely experiment or contribute to projects without effecting the original project
